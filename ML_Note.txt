		1.Introduction Of Machine Learning
		
	- first machine learning application in 1990 is a spam filter
	- Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to
learn without being explicitly programmed.	—Arthur Samuel, 1959
	- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to
some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.	—Tom Mitchell, 1997

		2. Type of machine learning
		
	- Supervise Learning : 	
- We called target in regression problem and label for classification problem
- for features they can be named Predictors oe attributes
	
	- Unsepervise learning :
- dimensionality reduction => feature extraction. is Approach were we merge two correlated feature in one.
	
	- Semi-supervised learning : 
		
	- Self-supervised learning : 
- transfer learning : Transferring knowledge from one task to another

	- Reinforcement learning :	
- best strategy => called a policy
- offline learning


	- Batch Versus Online Learning :

- Batch learning : is to train the model in new and old dataset to generate a new model
    - model rot or data drift
- Online learning :
    - learning incrementally
    - out-of-core learning
    - learning rate


	- Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning

- Instance-based learning :
- Model-based learning and a typical machine learning workflow :
    - model selection : choosing the type of model and fully specifying its architecture
    - Training a model : running an algorithm to find the model parameters that will make it best fit the training data
